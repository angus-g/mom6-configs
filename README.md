# MOM6 Configurations
## Zonal jet

This is a 100km x 10km zonally-reentrant domain with 2 layers. The
bathymetry is 2000m deep, with 10 sinusoidal bumps of 50m height. A
constant 0.1 Pa zonal stress is applied at the surface.

The intention of this configuration is to provide a testbed for the
online PDE-based highpass filtering.
